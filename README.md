# austin_animal_shelter_analysis

## Project Overview

This project is intended to look at Austin Animal Shelter outcomes for dogs, to help us understand what dogs are more likely to be adopted.

## Communication Protocols

This project team has established the following meeting schedules and processes for communication:

* Deadlines
    * The team, as of 5/19, agrees to hold to the following schedule:
        * Wednesday: Project roles will be determined for project segments.
        * Saturday by 1 PM: Initial attempts will be made for each project role, so team members can assist others as necessary. This will be attested to as a Slack "check-in."
        * Sunday by 1 PM: Final attempts will be submitted for each project role. If there are any additional issues, the team will approach the TA to resolve them expediently.

* Meetings
    * The team expects to meet twice per week to discuss team needs: Wednesdays at 7 PM and Sundays at 1 PM. Meetings will be conducted via video chat software of the team's choosing.

* Discussions
    * Outside of meeting times, for team member discussions, the team will primarily use Slack to discuss project needs and any logistical issues the team runs across.
    * In case of emergency, the team has put together a phone number list for additional communication outside of Slack.
