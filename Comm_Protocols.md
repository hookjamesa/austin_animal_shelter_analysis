### Communication Protocols

The project team has established the following meeting schedules and processes for communication:

* Weekly deadlines and check-in schedule:
    * Wednesday 7 PM: Any concerns regarding project roles, initial progress, plans for rest of the week are discussed and addressed.
    * Saturday by 1 PM: Initial attempts will be made for each project role, so team members can assist others as necessary. This will be attested to as a Slack "check-in."
    * Sunday by 1 PM: Final attempts will be submitted for each project role and reviewed by the team. If there are any additional issues, the team will approach the TA to resolve them expediently.

* Zoom Meetings
    * The team expects to meet twice per week to discuss team needs and peer-review work: Wednesdays at 7 PM and Sundays at 1 PM. 

* Discussions
    * Outside of meeting times, for team member discussions, the team will primarily use Slack to discuss project needs and any logistical issues the team runs across.
    * In case of emergency, the team has put together a phone number list for additional communication outside of Slack.
