### Slide 12
* Target variable is set for 'Adoption' only
* Train and test data sets as identified prior in the presentation
* Minimal data scaling as the project used a decision tree model

### Slide 13
* Due to the nature of people when they go to a shelter, we thought it best to have 2-3 decision points mimicking checklists people have as they go to an adoption center.
* Decision tree set to 4 iterations.
* 78% Accuracy, with improvement needed in recall rates. F1 score was over project established minimum as well.

### Slide 14
* Model outcome suggests that we can predict animal outcomes with some level of certainty. Dataset and simple decision tree model could be expanded on with additional data pre-processing and use of a Random Forest model.
* Most animals rotate quickly through the shelter - they have 1-2 months maximum.
* Customer behaviors are predictable as the shelter comes out of 2020, using this data to re-establish schedules, stakeholder needs, and customer needs.
